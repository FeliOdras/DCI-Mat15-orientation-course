                        <p>It was in 1999 when I "built" my first website. It was kind of crappy, built with Microsoft FrontPage, one of the first WYSIWYG desktop editors of its kind, and naturally it only worked in Internet Explorer. A few years later I came to a place called "c-base" (the people who run this place pretend to reconstruct a crashed space station, some of them might really believe it) and there I met some cool guys who really knew how to build a website. One of them showed me the German HTML reference project <a href="http://www.selfhtml.org" target="_blank">selfhtml.org</a>. 'If you want to build a website, read this', he said. So I did and so I fell in love with code.</p>
